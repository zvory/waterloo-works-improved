## WaterlooWorks Improved

I'm writing a FIreFox extention to make using waterlooworks easier. I'm using an example from [https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples) as a base for my extension.

Things this extension will do:
 - [x] CSS fixes, remove the horizontal scrolling (Done, for the most important places)
 - [x] Add middle click functionality
 - Allow the user to remove items from their shortlist after the posting has expired/the user has applied to the job (Thanks to @neilparikh for the suggestion)

Optional:
 - (match anything else other waterloo works chrome extensions do)
